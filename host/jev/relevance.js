// Deterministic narrowing of the action space, before any Jev call.
//
// Why this exists: a Wikipedia article yields 602 usable rows against a
// 255-option provider ceiling, which forced a Jev *scoring* request on every
// single step — doubling the round trips on exactly the pages that are already
// slowest. It also split probability mass across hundreds of options, which
// deflated confidence and escalated runs that were going fine.
//
// Measured composition of those 602 rows:
//
//     320  article links (body prose)
//     139  other links
//     115  citation markers — "[1]", "[2]", ...
//      14  controls (buttons and inputs)
//      11  no accessible name at all
//
// A purely lexical filter is NOT safe here: the goal "open the page's edit
// history" has zero word overlap with the link that does it, "Past revisions of
// this page". So lexical matching only ever ADDS rows here, never removes them.
// What removes rows is noise detection and, as a last resort, document order.

 *   1. rows matching the goal's own words, anywhere on the page (off-screen
 *      ones capped at OFFSCREEN_MATCH_CAP, strongest first)
 *   2. on-screen controls, then other on-screen rows
 *   everything else off screen is dropped — SCROLL reaches it if it matters
 * This follows jev-ultrafast, which offers only visible controls. The goal
 * tier is our addition, so a named target deep in the page is still one
 * CLICK away rather than a run of scrolls.
 *
 * Without on-screen information (the old read_page observation) the tiers are
 * the original three:
 *   1. rows matching the goal's own words, strongest match first
 *   2. controls, which are what actions are made of
 *   3. everything else, in document order, until the budget runs out
 *
 * Noise is dropped outright and never competes for the budget.
 *
 * Document order is the tie-breaker rather than a judgement: read_page emits in
 * document order, and actionable page chrome (nav, toolbars, tabs) sits near the
 * top while body prose runs long. Measured: the target was row 21 on the article
 * page and row 4 on the search page.
 *
 * Returns the surviving rows in document order — Jev reads them as a page.
