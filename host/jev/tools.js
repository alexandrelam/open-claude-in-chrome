Use this instead of a run of read_page/computer calls when the steps are mechanical (click through to a page, filter a list, fill a form whose values you supply). You keep planning: give one subgoal, an observable success condition, and any text to type. Returns the status, the steps taken, and an excerpt of the final page so you can continue without calling read_page. A status of needs_help, needs_value or blocked means it stopped deliberately and is handing control back to you — read `reason`, take that one step yourself with the ordinary tools, then call again with only the subgoals that remain rather than re-planning. A status of partial means every leg ran but some were skipped; `reason` lists them.",
